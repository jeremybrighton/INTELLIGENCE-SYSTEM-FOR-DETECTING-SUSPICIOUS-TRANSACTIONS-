## How to Use the Application

1. **Upload Dataset**: Go to `/upload` to upload a CSV file of transactions
2. **Analyze Transaction**: Go to `/explain`, enter a transaction ID, click "Explain"
3. **Save to Database**: Click "Save to Database" after analyzing to store for future predictions
4. **View Dashboard**: See the latest analyzed transaction on the dashboard
5. **Clear Data**: Click "Clear Data" button to reset all stored data

## ML Backend Integration

The frontend connects to the ML service at:
- **URL**: https://ml-file-for-url.onrender.com
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - GET `/health` - Health check
  - POST `/predict` - Single transaction fraud prediction
  - POST `/process-dataset` - Batch CSV processing
  - GET `/explain/<transaction_id>` - SHAP-based explanation

## Data Flow

1. User uploads CSV dataset on `/upload` page → ML processes it → Results stored in localStorage
2. User analyzes transaction on `/explain` page → Can save to database (localStorage)
3. Dashboard displays: processed dataset stats + latest analyzed transaction
4. Clear Data button resets everything

## Deployment

- **Frontend**: Deploy to Vercel (Next.js)
- **Backend**: ML service already running on Render
- **Flow**: Frontend fetches data from Render ML backend
